Project for the course of Complex Networks. Python simulation of a scale-free network to highlight the emergence of Bose-Einstein condensation phenomenon. Nodes represents energy levels while a link between two nodes represents two particles, one for each energy level. Nodes are characterized by a fitness parameter (Bianconi-Barab√†si model), which together with connectivity (= node degree) defines the probability of each node to attract links. As the size of the system increases, the most connected and with higher fitness parameter node tends to acquire a finite fraction of links, which stands for a Bose-Einstein condensate.
